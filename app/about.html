					<p>ABOUT</p>
					<p>Christine Guibara derives her inspiration from the world around her. She believes the most breathtaking forms develop from nature and can be emulated, appreciated, and enhanced through design. As a result, many of her pieces take on a raw and organic characteristic that has come to define her high quality work. Christine’s upbringing and education played intimate roles in shaping her career as a jeweler. During her youth, she spent countless hours at her father’s sculpting studio learning different artistic techniques and expanded her creative skills by helping her mother with interior design. Christine grew up in Northern California and is currently based in Burlingame near San Francisco. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Economics from UCLA, and received graduate degrees from both the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles and the Revere Academy of Jewelry Arts in San Francisco. All of these experiences have given her a variety of perspectives and skills to draw from in her own collection.</p>

				<p class="space">MATERIALS</p>
				<p>The quality of materials is of utmost importance to Christine. She handpicks each stone from the best suppliers in the industry. She chooses the highest quality stones available with little or no treatments after mining. Christine highlights her interest in preserving natural resources through the use of many untreated and reclaimed materials. The metals Christine works with are no exception to her standards. She works with high karat gold and Argentium sterling silver, paying close attention to the alloys and origins of each metal. Platinum is also available for custom work.</p>
